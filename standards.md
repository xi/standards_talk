# Introduction

-	everyone respects standards
-	very few people know how standards are created

# What is a standard?

-	A (technical) specification is a standard if it is widely established.
-	It may be a *de facto* or *de jure* standard, where only the latter has
	gone through a formal standardization process with an established
	standardization organisation.
-	A standard therefore needs legitimacy

# parties involved

stakeholders
:	anyone with an interest in a proposed standard
implementors
:	anyone who will implement (parts of) the standard
users
:	anyone who might use an implementation
sponsor
:	proposes a specification for standardization
standardization organisation
:	organisation which manages the standardization process
working group (WG)
:	the people who manage the standardization process
	for the *standardization organisation*
advisors/experts
:	external people who are asked to participate in the standardization
	process. May be members of the *working group*

# open standard

-	anyone (especially implementors) have unrestricted access
	(e.g. no fees or classification)
-	free implementations must exist
-	anyone can participate in the creation and further development of the standard

# decentralization

-	hacker ethics call for decentralization
-	standards provide ways for decentralizing technology
-	at the same time, the standardization process itself is
	necessarily centralized

# overview of standardization organisations

# International Organisation for Standardization (ISO)
-	ISO 639 – Codes for the representation of names of languages (de_DE)
-	ISO 8601 – Representation of dates and times (1999-12-31 23:59:58)
-	ISO/IEC 8859 – 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets
-	ISO/IEC 26300 – Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.0
-	ISO/IEC 29500 – Office Open XML File Formats
-	specs are not open (fees)
-	only member organisations are allowed to vote

# Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN)
-	DIN 476: international paper sizes (now ISO 216)

# Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
-	IEEE 802.x – networking
-	IEEE 1003 – Unix compatibility programming standard - POSIX
-	allowed to vote is "any individual who has expressed an interest in the subject matter of the standard"

# Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
-	RFC 1034/1035 DNS
-	RFC 1157 IMAP
-	RFC 2616 HTTP
-	RFC 2821 SMTP
-	RFC 1149 IP on Avian Carriers (Pidgins)
-	RFC 2324 Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol
-	"rough consensus and running code"
-	discussion on archived mailing lists

# World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
-	founded and headed by Tim Berners-Lee
-	HTML/CSS
-	WCAG
-	Working Draft - anyone is asked for comment
-	Candidate Recommendation - implementors are asked for feedback
-	Proposed Recommendation - W3C advisory council is asked to approve
-	W3C Recommendation
-	no certification program, but free validators
-	members are mostly big companies like IBM, Google, Facebook, Deutsche Telekom etc.
-	discussion on archived mailing lists

# WHAT WG
-	formed when W3C was moving in a different direction than implementors
-	HTML5

# python/bittorrent
-	"rough consensus and running code"
-	<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/>
-	<http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0001.html>
-	PEP/BEP (Python/BitTorrent Enhancement Proposals)
-	author responsible for building consensus
-	open source reference implementation needed
-	spec must be in public domain
-	Benevolent Dictator for Life, Guido van Rossum/Bram Cohen

# standardization process

-	someone proposes a draft
-	it must be accepted
-	a working group may be formed
-	the process may go through several phases getting inputs from the general public, experts and implementors
-	a high majority or even consensus is required
-	additional requirements (e.g. reference implementation)
-	the final vote is on a closed group of people, e.g. benevolent dictators or member organisations

# critique

> [...] the ostensibly open process of the W3C actually isn’t open: It’s
> dominated by multinationals; the opinions of everyone other than invited
> experts can be and are ignored; invited-expert status has been refused or
> revoked; the Working Group can claim that “consensus” has been reached even
> in the face of unresolved internal disagreement; the process is itself
> inaccessible to people with disabilities, like deaf people; WCAG Working
> Group chairs have acted like bullies.

# What we can learn from this

-	standards as a different decision goal than laws
-	decision making in a given process needs to be standardized
-	the standardization process itself is optimized for output
	legitimacy by providing enough resources to reach a high
	quality specification, maybe even a consensus

# What we can provide for this

-	a better tool for proposing alternative versions and commenting (absatzweise Kommentieren)
-	reaching consensus in long meetings and discussions is currently
	out of our scope
